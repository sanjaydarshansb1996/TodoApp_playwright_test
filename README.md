# Next.js ToDo App

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Features

- **Next.js:** Utilizes the power of Next.js for server-side rendering, routing, and a seamless development experience.

- **Interactive ToDo List:** Users can easily add new tasks to their to-do list and mark them as completed.
